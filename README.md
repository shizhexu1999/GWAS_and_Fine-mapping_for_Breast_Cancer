# **GWAS and Fine-mapping for CKB Breast Cancer**
**********************************************

## Description
Apply tools **REGENIE**/**SAIGE** to conduct GWAS analysis for the CKB breast cancer data, and it is necessary to go through steps such as population stratification and covariate computation.

We then apply various fine-mapping methods to identify credible sets and true causal variants. These fine-mapping tools can also be integrated into a machine learning framework.

The details of the code and dataset are not publicly available at this stage due to data sensitivity.

## Roadmap
The roadmap plan is still in progress.

## Acknowledgement
The autocompletion feature of GitHub Copilot was passively used throughout the code development process. It is pervasive to all the code without the use of any specific prompts.
